Installation Guide for Windows
----------------------------------

For now, xLearn can support Windows. This page gives instructions on how to build and install the xLearn from source code on Windows. Before starting,  make sure that your Windows has already installed  ``Visual Studio 2017`` and ``CMake``. 

Install Visual Studio 2017
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*If you have already installed your C++ compiler before, you can skip this step.*

Download Visual Studio ``vs_xxxx_xxxx.exe`` from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/, then you can follow the VS2017 install guide
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2017. Users should make sure that choose the c++
development tools when install VS2017.
 
Install CMake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*If you have already installed CMake before, you can skip this step.*

Download latest(at least v3.10) package for windows from https://cmake.org/download/ and then install it. whether you choose ``.msi`` or ``.zip`` package, 
you should make sure that cmake is added to your system path.

Install xLearn from Source Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Building xLearn from source code consists two steps:

First, you need to build the executable files (``xlearn_train.exe`` and ``xlearn_predict.exe``), as well as the 
shared library (``xlearn_api.dll`` for Windows) from the C++ code. After that, users need to install the xLearn Python Package.

Build from Source Code
=======================
First, users should enter DOS as Administrator. 
Then, users need to clone the code from github: ::

  git clone https://github.com/aksnzhy/xlearn.git

  cd xlearn
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 Win64" ../
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
  MSBuild xLearn.sln /p:Configuration=Release
  
**Note:** You should replace this path ``"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat"``
to yourself installation path of VS2017.

Suppose you install the VS Community version, the path should be ``"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat"``
if you install it in default path.

If the building is successful, users can find two executable files (``xlearn_train.exe`` and ``xlearn_predict.exe``) in the ``build\Release`` path. 
Users can test the installation by using the following command: ::

  run_example.bat

Build from Visual Studio solution
=======================
This build method is optional for Build from Source Code, if you already use method above, you can skip this part.

We support an Visual Studio(vs) solution for users, it's in the directory ``windows`` which is in root of xLearn project. 

There are three vs project in this solution: ``xlearn_train``, ``xlearn_test``, ``xlearn_api``, respectively relation to build executable train,predict entry program and DLL(dynamic link library) API for windows. 

Users should make sure that your vs platform toolset is greater than v141(It works well if you use vs2017).

**Note:** Files(both executable file and DLL) compiling from this solution is different from cmake solution, because of different structure.

Install Python Package
=======================

Then, you can install the Python package through ``install-python.sh``: ::

  cd python-package
  python setup.py install 

You can also test the Python package by using the following command: ::

  cd ../
  python test_python.py

One-Button Building
=======================

We have already write a script ``build.bat`` to do all the cumbersome work for users, and users can just use the folloing commands: ::

  git clone https://github.com/aksnzhy/xlearn.git

  cd xlearn
  build.bat

You should make sure that you enter DOS as Administrator.

Install xLearn from pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We provide Python package on Windows, it supports these Python(x64) versions: ``2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7``.

Users can download this binary python package from tab release_, then use ``pip`` command install the ``.whl`` file which you download.

.. _release: https://github.com/aksnzhy/xlearn/releases

After that, you can type the following script in your python shell to check whether the xLearn has been installed successfully: ::

  >>> import xlearn as xl
  >>> xl.hello()

You will see the following message if the installation is successful: ::
