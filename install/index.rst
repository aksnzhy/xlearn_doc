Installation Guide
----------------------------------

For now, xLearn can support both Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. To install xLearn on Windows, please go to `this page`__. This page gives instructions on how to build and install the xLearn using ``pip`` and how to build xLearn from source code on Linux and Mac OSX. No matter what way you choose, make sure that your OS has already installed ``GCC`` or ``Clang`` 
(with the support of ``C++ 11``) and ``CMake``. 

.. __: ./install_windows.html

Install GCC or Clang
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*If you have already installed your C++ compiler before, you can skip this step.*

* On Cygwin, run ``setup.exe`` and install ``gcc`` and ``binutils``.
* On Debian/Ubuntu Linux, type the command: ::

      sudo apt-get install gcc binutils 

  to install GCC (or Clang) by using: :: 

      sudo apt-get install clang 

* On FreeBSD, type the following command to install Clang: :: 

      sudo pkg_add -r clang 

* On Mac OS X, install ``XCode`` gets you Clang.


Install CMake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*If you have already installed CMake before, you can skip this step.*

* On Cygwin, run ``setup.exe`` and install cmake.
* On Debian/Ubuntu Linux, type the command to install cmake: ::

      sudo apt-get install cmake

* On FreeBSD, type the command: ::
   
      sudo pkg_add -r cmake

On Mac OS X, if you have ``homebrew``, you can use the command: :: 

     brew install cmake

or if you have ``MacPorts``, run: :: 

     sudo port install cmake

You won't want to have both Homebrew and MacPorts installed.

Install xLearn from Source Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Building xLearn from source code consists two steps:

First, you need to build the executable files (``xlearn_train`` and ``xlearn_predict``), as well as the 
shared library (``libxlearn_api.so`` for Linux or ``libxlearn_api.dylib`` for Mac OSX) from the C++ code. After that, users need to install the xLearn Python Package.

Build from Source Code
=======================

Users need to clone the code from github: ::

  git clone https://github.com/aksnzhy/xlearn.git

  cd xlearn
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../
  make

If the building is successful, users can find two executable files (``xlearn_train`` and ``xlearn_predict``) in the ``build`` path. Users can test the installation by using the following command: ::

  ./run_example.sh

Install Python Package
=======================

Then, you can install the Python package through ``install-python.sh``: ::

  cd python-package
  sudo ./install-python.sh

You can also test the Python package by using the following command: ::

  cd ../
  python test_python.py

One-Button Building
=======================

We have already write a script ``build.sh`` to do all the cumbersome work for users, and users can just use the folloing commands: ::

  git clone https://github.com/aksnzhy/xlearn.git

  cd xlearn
  sudo ./build.sh

You may be asked to input your password during installation.

Install xLearn from pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to install xLearn Python package is to use ``pip``. The following command will 
download the xLearn source code from pip and install Python package locally. You must make sure that you have already installed C++11 and CMake in your local machine: ::

    sudo pip install xlearn

The installation process will take a while to complete. After that, you can type the following script in your python shell to check whether the xLearn has been installed successfully: ::

  >>> import xlearn as xl
  >>> xl.hello()

You will see the following message if the installation is successful: ::
